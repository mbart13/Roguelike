# Roguelike game

## Story

"La Speluna", a company from San Escobar contacted you and asked
about creating a roguelike game for them. They didn't tell us much about
their needs, only a few details about the game's framework. They are big
fans of old-fashioned RPG games when graphics didn't matter that much,
but the most important things were gameplay and a story.

The game should be about a creature (human? alien? ant? hacker?) who is
travelling through a dangerous and wild world (forest? planet? table?
meetups?). In the beginning, the creature is weak and fragile, but
through the game he (she? they? apache helicopter?) will be levelling
up, getting tougher, collecting powerful items, and finally be able to
defeat an ultimate boss! Of course, the way to the ultimate boss isn't a
bed of roses, there will be a lot of obstacles (rivers? craters? drops
of milk? firewalls?) and many dangerous enemies. Use your imagination!.

In this project your job is to implement a
[Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) game.
